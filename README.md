# Feed Forward Neural Network for IMDB Sentiment Analysis Dataset
In this project, I develop a sentiment classifier using a single feed-forward neural network for the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset.

To optimize the performance of the model, I experiment with different hyperparameters including the number of hidden layers, the number of units in each layer, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.

The model is preprocessed with a **GloVe** pre-trained word embedding vectors to help capture semantic information in the text. Additionally, a detailed preprocessing notebook is included to showcase the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

The best model is then selected and explained with justification, including a visualization of the loss vs epochs and a ROC curve. The implementation of the solution is done using **PyTorch** and the report is well-documented.
